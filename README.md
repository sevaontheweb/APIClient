This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Starting the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Dummy virtualization server master should be started separately. By default, it is estimated by path http://localhost:8090 . If virtualization server runs by different address, the address should be in "virtserverpath" query parameter, for instance: 


### `http://localhost:3000?virtserverpath=http://localhost:8091`

## Running tests
Tests are started by running in the project directory.

### `npm test`
